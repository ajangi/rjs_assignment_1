# Requirements
React Native apps may target iOS 9.0 and Android 4.1 (API 16) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like Expo can be used to work around this.
# Installing dependencies
 You will need Node, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, and Android Studio. While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Android Studio in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for Android.
### Node
Follow the installation instructions for your Linux distribution to install Node 8.3 or newer.

### The React Native CLI
Node comes with npm, which lets you install the React Native command line interface.
Run the following command in a Command Prompt or shell:
```sh
$ npm install -g react-native-cli
```
